# Parseval-networks
This repository is the result of my universtity project with the goal to implement some of the models and reproduce some of the results from the [Parseval networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08847) paper. The main idea of the paper is to control the Lipschitz norm of the model by enforcing weight matrices to be nearly orthognal and having a spectral norm of 1.

There are some (unintended) differences between the original models and those implemented here. The reuslts of the experiments are in section 3 in this [report](https://github.com/Ivan1248/Parseval-networks/blob/master/report/izvjestaj.pdf) (it's in Croatian).
